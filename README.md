## Description

This is a website built for a fictional museum called Community science museum. The target audience for this project was 7-15 years old and families with small children and the goal of this site is to make people want to go to this museum. This website has a simple navigation with links to five pages, a Homepage, an Explore page, a star club page, Exhibitions, and a contact us page. The site uses a three or two-column grid depending on the page for desktop and a single-column grid for mobile, I tried to use fun and lively colors. The site has 8 HTML pages.

### Homepage:
The home page has four sections, the first section is a welcoming message with a CTA to the young star club page, and the second section is about the opening hours and exhibits with a CTA to the exhibits page. The third section is about special events, and the last section is about how to “get involved” with a CTA to the contact page.

### Explore page:
The explore page got three sections about what to do in the museum.

### Exhibition page:
This page is about the different exhibitions and got a CTA leading to them. 

### Contact page:
The contact page has two sections, first section is contact information and the second is a contact form.

### Star club page:
The Star Club page has two sections with information about a club for children that the museum offers.
