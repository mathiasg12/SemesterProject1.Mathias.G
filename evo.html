                    For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                    Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.
